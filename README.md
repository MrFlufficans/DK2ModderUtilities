# Modification Check
This Tool is used to check for Modified Files after an Update.

1.  To use it place the Script into the Game Directories Data Folder and Run the Script.
2.  If there is a New version it will prompt you to Update a Simple Yes or Y will suffice, You can Decline but I would suggest Updating.
2a. If you let it update itself It will Automatically Replace itself and Relaunch.
3.  It will Prompt you for How many Days back you want to compare to, e.g 5 will give you a list of everything Modified from then to the moment you press Enter.
4.  After displaying the List it will Output it to a Text file Labelled Results.txt in the same Folder the Script is in.
